3. What is the Product?
Funny Fruits is a pack of digital files. The main idea is fun fruit with silly faces.

The main part is a set of coloring pages. Each page has a fun fruit. Think of a happy strawberry or a cool avocado. They are black and white drawings.

But the big part is the rights. It has Private Label Rights (PLR).

What is PLR? It means you own it. You can change it. You can put your name on it. Best of all, you can sell it and keep all the money. You do not have to make anything new.

4. The Good and The Bad
I looked at everything. Here is my fair list of good and bad points.

The Good Parts:
Ready to Sell Now: This is the best part. The product is done. You do not need to be an artist. You can start to sell it right away.
Very Low Cost: It only costs $17. This is a cheap way to start a business. You could make a lot more money back.
Many People Want It: Kids and adults always like coloring books. The “silly faces” theme is fun for children.
You Can Make Money: The PLR license lets you sell it. This is a strong right.
Saves You Time: Making 100 coloring pages takes an artist weeks. This pack gives you the work now.
Comes With Extras: You also get book covers and ad pictures. This makes your product look pro.
The Bad Parts:
Not Just Yours: Other people can buy this same pack and sell it. You are not the only one. This means you have to compete.
You Must Market It: The product will not sell itself. You need to find buyers.
More Offers For More: The first offer is good. But the other offers give you more pages and a ready-made store.
Just One Theme: The pack is all about fruit. This is a specific idea. You cannot use it for other things, like cars.
5. How Does It Work?
Using Funny Fruits to make money is easy. It has three simple steps.

Step 1: Buy and Get the Files
First, you buy the Funny Fruits pack. Then, you go to the member’s area. You download all the files. The pack has:

The main coloring book PDF (100+ pages).
Single picture files for each design.
Ready-made book covers.
Ad pictures to help you sell.
Step 2: Make It Your Own (This is your choice)
Next, you can change the product. Since you have PLR rights, you can:

Add your name as the writer on the cover.
Put pages together to make a new book.
Change the title.
Use single pages as a free gift to get email addresses.
This step makes it your product.

Step 3: Sell and Keep All the Money
Last, you make a simple sales page and start to sell. You can sell the digital file on:

Your own website.
Etsy or other craft sites.
Social media like Facebook.
Every dollar you make is yours. You do not pay the first maker any fee.

6. What Are The Parts?
The Funny Fruits pack has many useful things. Here is what you get:

100+ Fun Fruit Coloring Pages: This is the main thing. You get many cute fruit pictures. Each one is a clear, kid-safe drawing.
Full PLR Money-Making License: This is your permit to make money. It says you can sell, change, and say you made it. This license is the key to the whole plan.
Ready Book Covers and Inside Pages: You get pro-made front and back covers. The inside pages are set for printing. This means you can also sell real books on Amazon KDP.
Extra: 50+ Computer-Made Coloring Pictures: On top of the 100 main pages, you get 50 more pictures. This adds more value for no extra cost.
Social Media Ad Kit: This has pre-made pictures and “mockups”. A mockup shows your book on a tablet or in a kid’s hands. These pictures make your ads look pro.
7. What Can You Do With This Product?
You can do many things with PLR. Here are the best ways to use Funny Fruits:

Sell it as a Digital Coloring Book: This is the easiest way. Sell the PDF on Etsy, your own site, or on sites like Gumroad.
Sell a Real Book on Amazon KDP: Use the ready-to-print PDF and cover to make a real book. You can sell it on Amazon. When someone buys it, Amazon prints and mails it. This is true passive income.
Use Pages to Get Emails: Give a few free pages from the pack on your site. People give you their email address to get them. This helps you build an email list to talk to again and again.
Make a Monthly Box: You could use the pages in a monthly kids’ activity box. This is a smart way to make money each month.
** Sell Single Pages on Etsy:** Some people like to buy small sets of pages. You can put 5-10 pages in a mini-set and sell it for less money.
8. Who Should Get This Product?
Funny Fruits is a great start for many people:

Brand New Beginners: If you want to start a web business but do not know what to sell, this is perfect. It gives you a done product now.
Etsy Sellers: Sellers on Etsy always want new digital products. This pack fits there well.
Amazon KDP Sellers: People who sell books on Amazon will like this pack. It gives them all they need for a coloring book.
Moms, Dads, and Teachers: They can use these pages for their own kids or at school. They can also sell them to other parents and teachers.
Bloggers: If you have a site for parents or kids, you can use these pages as a free gift to get more people to your site.
9. How to Make Money With This Product
Making money with Funny Fruits is a simple process. Here is a clear plan:

Pick Your Store: First, choose where you will sell. For new people, Etsy is a good pick. It has lots of people who want digital files like coloring pages.
Make Your Listings: Next, set up your Etsy shop (it is easy). Then, use the pictures from the Funny Fruits pack to make your listing look pro. Write a clear title like “Funny Fruits Coloring Book for Kids – 100+ Pages, Get It Now.”
Set a Good Price: Since your cost is only $17, you can set a low price. A normal price is $5 to $15. Even at $5, you only need to sell a few to make your money back.
Get People to Look: Last, you need to get eyes on your product. You can:
Use Pinterest: Pin your coloring page pictures and link to your Etsy shop. Pinterest is great for things you can see.
Share on Facebook Groups: Find groups for parents and share your product (if the rules say you can).
Keep All the Money: When you make a sale, you just email the buyer the PDF file. Etsy can do this for you. The money is all yours. After just 4 sales at $5 each, you have made a profit!

11. Can You Get Your Money Back?
The seller gives a standard 30-day money-back guarantee.

This means you can buy the pack, get all the files, and try them. If you are not happy for any reason, you can ask for all your money back in 30 days. This makes it a very safe thing to try.

12. Is The Product Worth It?
Yes, I think it is worth the money.

For a one-time cost of $17, you get a full product you can sell. You do not need any special skills. You could easily make your money back and more.

The PLR license is the key. It makes a simple download into a business thing. You will have to compete with others, but the low cost and high want for coloring books make it a good bet.

So, if you will do the simple work to set up a sales page and do some marketing, Funny Fruits is worth the small cost.

13. Questions People Ask
Q: Do I need to be an artist to use this?
A: No! The art is already done for you. That is the whole point.

Q: Can I really sell this on Etsy and Amazon?
A: Yes! Since you have Private Label Rights, you are the legal owner. You can sell it on those sites.

Q: What if others sell the same thing?
A: This happens with PLR. The key is to be different. Change the book cover, use a new title, or sell the pages with other things. My free templates will help you.

Q: Do I need the more offers?
A: No, the first offer is a full product. But the more offers give you more pages to sell. This can mean more money. You can start with the $17 one and get more later if you want.

Q: Can I use this for Amazon KDP?
A: Yes. The files are ready to print. You can use the cover and inside PDF to sell a real book on Amazon KDP with no trouble.

14. My Final Thoughts
Last Words: Funny Fruits is a GOOD and USEFUL PLR pack.

This is not a trick to get rich fast. It is a real product you can sell today. The art is nice, the theme is fun for kids, and the rights give you all the power.

The low price makes it a safe way to try digital products. If you follow the easy steps to sell on Etsy or Amazon KDP, you can make your money back and start a small business.

Just recall, you must take action. You need to set up your shop and tell people about it. But the hard work—making the product—is done for you.

If you are ready to start your online business with a fun product, I say get Funny Fruits. Do not forget to use my link and get my free gifts for more help!
